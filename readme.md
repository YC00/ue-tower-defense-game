Unreal Tower Defense Game
=========================

Disclaimer
----------

All the rights of source and assets of this project belong to Epic Games. This is just an uploaded copy of a backup I had, as this project disappeared from the official epic games store.

Some changes were made by the community, here at github, to the project to work under unreal engine 4.25. If you still wanna get the original code, check the [`legacy`][legacy] branch. That branch contains the code as I did found it in my hard drive (may have minor changes, but probably not important).

Documentation

Official documentation can still be found in unreal's docs:
